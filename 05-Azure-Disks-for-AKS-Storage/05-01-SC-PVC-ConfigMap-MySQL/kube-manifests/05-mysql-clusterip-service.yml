  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql 
  ports: 
    - port: 3306  
  clusterIP: None # This means we are going to use Pod IP    
  #ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType

# ClusterIP exposes the following: 
#spec.clusterIp:spec.ports[*].port
# You can only access this service while inside the cluster. It is accessible from its spec.clusterIp port. If a spec.ports[*].targetPort is set it will 
# route from the port to the targetPort. The CLUSTER-IP you get when calling kubectl get services is the IP assigned to this service within the cluster internally.
